Thanks to SuperKael for introducing me to TranspilerHelper. Some patches are now written in TranspilerHelper.
Implement Chamcham hat augment changes.

It also applies a few changes and fixes.

- Useless augments now have a useful effect.
- Quadracopter is functionally fixed for multiplayer.
- Quadracopter now only costs 30 MP. (Configurable)
- Add more random names from franchises for character creation.
