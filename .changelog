Add a new effect for Eyepod Hat augment. It is functional but I want to UI to be consistent.
Description:
This mod adds a wide array of custom Combat Chips, all available in Old Earth.
It also applies a few changes and fixes.
- Gadget RPG now increases TEC instead of DEX and FTH.
- Useless augments now have a useful effect.
- Quadracopter is functionally fixed for multiplayer.
- Quadracopter now only costs 30 MP. (Configurable)
- Add more random names from franchises for character creation.
